Heteroskedasticity makes usual standard errors invalid
OLS is not biased as a result of hetero It may be ine¢ cient but improving efficiency is hard
Homoskedastic regression means use standardized residuals at 95% (-2,2)
If E (xu) 6 = 0 then ZCM violatedand we have an endogenous regressor or and endogeneity problem

NEED TO KNOW: PROXY VARIABLE SOLUTION 

Note that the Proxy solution is used when we are interested in the
effect of a variable (educ) while using a proxy for a di§erent variable
that we wanted to control for (ability) but for which we did not have
a proper measure
Fundamentally di§erent from Errors in Variables
