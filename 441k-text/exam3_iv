n class we considered the estimation of a demand equation for fish. The specification to be
used is in the simple linear regression form,
lquant = b0 +b1*lprice + u
1. (3 points) What would be interpretation of the coefficient on lprice (ie the slope
coefficient)?

Own price elasticity of demand for fish
Below is the simple linear regression of log quantity on log price using the daily data from
the Fulton fish market. The demand
regress lquan lprice
Why does the least squares regression procedure give biased and inconsistent
estimates in this case?
The ZCM (ass. 3) is violated because shocks to demand will affect the price of fish – so u is
correlated with lprice – or if mentioned simultaneity

A variable in the data that affects supply but not demand is stormy which is a dummy variable
for whether or not the weather at sea (where fish are caught) is stormy or not. Here are two
regression involving this variable:
regress lquan stormy
regress lprice stormy

Using these estimates discuss whether or not stormy can serve as an instrument
for lprice in the estimation of the demand equation.
It is significant in the second OLS of lprice on stormy – p value is 0.0000 so it is strongly
positively related with lprice as needed (full credit). 2 bonus points if they also said stormy at
sea should not affect demand on shore – ie it’s valid

Using information provided (and your cheat sheet) find the instrumental
variable estimate of the coefficient on lprice and interpret this estimate
B1hat = -0.362891/0.3352623 = (about -1) = -1.08 (stormy lquan coeff / stormy lprice coeff)
