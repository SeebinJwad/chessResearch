This example considers the linear probability model to explain whether or not a high school
graduate decided to attend college (either a 2 year or 4 year college). Here are the descriptions of
the variables used.
grades average grade on 13 point scale with 1 = highest

female = 1 if female
asian = 1 if asian
hispan = 1 if hispan
black = 1 if black
college = 1 if chose to attend college

Using the output provided so far find the sample proportion that attended
college for the following groups:
a. All racial categories combined:
0.790194 (Mean very bottom summary statistics next to college)
b. Whites: (ie not asian, Hispanic or black)
0.7836 (cons_ coef)
c. Hispanics:
0.7836+0.0157 (_cons+coeff hispan)
d. Asians:
0.7836+0.1086 (_cons+coeff asian)
e. Blacks:
0.7836-0.04426 (_cons+coeff - black bc black neg)

Is race a significant determinant of college attendance? Justify your answer
with an appropriate hypothesis test(s).
The overall goodness of fit test (F test) has a p-value of 0.0000 suggesting the race dummies
are jointly significant. (Full Credit) Take off 1 point if just looked at individual coefficients
(correctly noting Asian is significant at 1% and black is sig. at 5% but Hispanic is not)


In one sentence explain why the robust command was used.
To deal with heteroskedasticity in the LPM

What is the interpretation of the coefficient on grades?
A decrease in grades of 1 unit (an improvement) increases prob of college by 0.0716 or
7.16% (or vice versa) holding fixed race â€“ take off a point if they did not say conditional on
race (coeff of grades)

Find the predicted probability of choosing to attend college for a white person
with the highest possible grades (ie grades = 1).
Phat = 1.23533 -0.0716= 1.637 >1 (_cons + (negative) coeff of grades)

If one instead used a probit model the predicted value for the person in the
previous question would be (circle one):
i) Lower

Note the change in the coefficient on black. Provide an interpretation for the
black coefficient in the last regression and comparing it to the interpretation in the first
regression explain why the coefficient has changed so much.
Holding fixed grades a black is more likely to attend college than a white person. (Full
credit) In the earlier regression we did not control for grades so overall blacks are less likely
to attend college and they are likely to have lower grades so the coefficient in the first case is
much more negative.
