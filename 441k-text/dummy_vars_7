PROGRAM EVALUATION EXAMPLE:
Estimate the e§ect of an economic or social program on individuals,firms, cities etc.
Simplest case, there are 2 groups of subjects;
control group does not participate in the program while the
treatment group does participate - and we compare the outcomes for
the 2 groups
Create a dummy for treatment di - if di is random then regress
yi=a+Bdi+ui gives average treatment effect

As an example I could interact, nonwhite with female as follows: generate float femnon = female*nonwhite

GENDER ON WAGES DUMMY DIFF IN SLOPES:
Suppose we want to test whether the return to education is the same
for men and women, after allowing for a constant (or intercept)
difference. For simplicity, include only gender and education in the
wage model:
wage = (β0 + δ0 female) + (β1 + δ1 female) educ + u
set female = 0 and we Önd the intercept for males is β0, and the slope
on education for males is β1.
set female = 1 and we find the intercept for females is β0 + δ0, and
the slope on education for females is β1 + δ1;
δ0 measures the difference in intercepts for men and women, and δ1
measures the di§erences in returns to education for men and women
