Including Irrelevant Variables - You added variable that has a zero population coefficient.
Omitting Relevant Variables-You left out a variable that has a non-zero population coefficient
Long: y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + u
Short: y = β0 + β1x1 + uS
E (uL | x1, x2 ) = 0 : ZCM
ZCM is also valid for Short since β2 = 0 implies uS = uL
V (  ̃β1 ) < V ( ˆβ1 )
Two cases ommited variable bias=0:
β2 = 0,
 ̃δ = 0, ie: x1 and x2 are uncorrelated
Corr(x1, x2 ) > 0 Corr(x1, x2 ) < 0
β2 > 0 positive bias negative bias
β2 < 0 negative bias positive bias
