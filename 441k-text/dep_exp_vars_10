DEPENDENT VARIABLE:
Suppose that we would actually like to run,
y*= β0+β1x1+u but instead of y* we have its noisy measure y=y*+e, e measurement error
relationship between y and x is y=B0+B1x1+u+e
This will be a valid regression if ZCM is satisÖed which requires x1 be
uncorrelated with both u and e
As long as the measurement error is not correlated with the regressor
we are in good shape
Note that variance of the actual residual will be larger than in the
ideal regression,
Var (u + e) = Var (u) + Var (e)
assuming no covariance between u and e

EXPLANATORY VARIABLE:
Nopw suppose that the regressor (or independent variable) is mismeasured
Ideal regression, y = β0 + β1x*+u, but we see x1=x1*+e
Classic EIV assumption is that e is uncorrelated with xi*
Observed regression,
y = β0 + β1x1 + (u -B1e) Get violation of ZCM since x1 is correlated with actual residual:
u=B1e because x1 is correlated with e

attenuation bias in model coefficients caused by measurement error or noise in your independent (X) variables. Your model coefficients become biased towards 0.

Summary: Check your data for outliers ñ could indicate a problem in the data
