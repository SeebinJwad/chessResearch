In a model for a qualitative dependent variable it does NOT matter, in terms of interpretation, whether I code for the variable 0 for no and 1 for yes or the other way around.
True


One obtains more precise estimates when using a panel data set consisting of T=2 observations on n individuals as opposed to a single cross-section of the same n individuals because there is twice as much data.
False
Forecasts of future values from a stationary AR(1) model will converge to the mean of the process the further ahead that one forecasts.
True
In the linear probability model there is a violation of the Zero Conditional Mean Assumption because the residual is heteroskedastic whenever there are regressors in the model
False
The random walk without drift is stationary because there is no linear trend in the mean of the process
False
Taking logarithms of a variable will always make the variable be stationary and weakly dependent
False
Pooled cross section data (i.e., independent cross sections draw at different points in time) can be used in order to solve the "unobserved heterogeneity" (or the "omitted variable bias") problem
False

Fitted values from the linear probability model will be between 0 and 1
True
Suppose one is interested in the simple linear regression of y on x in which x is endogenous (correlated with the residual). A variable z will be a good instrument for x if it is correlated with y.
False
Why is it a good idea to use the robust command
The linear probability model has heteroskedastic residuals when there are regressors with non-zero coefficients.

When we have the AR(1) process with β1=1 then we have what is called a
random walk with drift (when β1 can also just be very close to 1) if random walk then not stationary
In AR(1) when absolute value of β1 is β1<1 we call this
weak dependence
in a probit model, probability is restricted from
(0,1)
Pooling independent cross-sections across time will allow one to deal with correlation between the individual specific part of the residual and regressors.
False
For a random walk without drift the best forecast of future values is always equal to the most recent value.
True

A random walk with nonzero drift is a weakly dependent process.
False
The assumptions MLR.1-MLR.6 are more plausible with time series data as opposed to cross section data because the R squared is usually higher with time series data
False
With panel data it is implausible to assume that MLR.2 is satisfied
True
Serial correlation in a time series regression makes the usual standard errors invalid.
True

In the Logit Model for qualitative responses, the fitted values will lie between 0 and 1.
True
If y and x are trending time series then taking the natural logarithm will remove the trends.
False
In a panel data model if both components of the residual (ie. ai and uit) are uncorrelated with the regressors then pooled least squares will be unbiased.
True
