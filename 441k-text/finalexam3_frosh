priGPA prior GPA (in semesters prior to this course)
ACT performance on the ACT exam (taken in high school)
frosh 1 if student is a freshman, 0 otherwise
soph 1 if student is a sophomore, 0 otherwise

Explain in words what the soph coefficient estimate means.
The expected final score for sophomores, holding priGPA and ACT fixed, is 0.73 points lower
than upper-classmen (i.e., those that are not freshmen and not sophomore)

Explain how you would test whether there is any effect of class (that is, freshman
vs sophomore vs others) in this regression. Be specific about the null hypothesis of interest
and the “restricted” regression that would be needed for the hypothesis test.
The null hypothesis is H0: Bfrosh = Bsoph = 0. To do the partial F-test, we would do a
“restricted” regression by dropping frosh and soph

Your classmate suggests that prior GPA is probably less important for freshmen as
a predictor of final exam performance (since prior GPA is based upon a single semester for
freshmen). What variable would you add to the model to allow for this possibility? And
what sign would you expect for this variable’s coefficient estimate if your classmate is
correct?
The interaction priGPA*frosh allows the affect of priGPA (on final) to vary for freshmen and
non-freshmen. If the effect of priGPA is lower for freshmen, this would be picked up by a
negative estimate on the interaction variable

What is the predicted difference in final-exam performance between freshmen and
non-freshmen at given values of priGPA = 3.5 and ACT = 30?
The estimated expected difference would be 7.034 – 1.681 (3.5) – 0.122 (30).
Coeff frosh + coeff frosh gpa * 3.5 + froshACT * 30

For non-freshmen, what is the expected effect of a 0.1 point increase in priGPA
and a 1 point increase in ACT upon final exam performance?
The effect for non-freshmen would be 0.1*(2.7557) + 1.0*(0.3762) = 0.6518.

For non-freshmen, what is the expected effect of a 0.1 point increase in priGPA
and a 1 point increase in ACT upon final exam performance?
The effect for non-freshmen would be 0.1*(2.7557) + 1.0*(0.3762) = 0.6518.
.1*priGPA coeff + 1.0 *ACT coeff

Suppose you want to test whether or not a 0.1 point increase in priGPA has the
same expected effect (on final) as a 1 point increase in ACT for non-freshmen. State the
appropriate null hypothesis, and state the number of restrictions (“q”) in the null hypothesis.
The null hypothesis is H0: 0.1BpriGPA = BACT. There is a single restriction (q=1) in the null
hypothesis (even though two parameters appear).

Which of the two following regressions would have a larger R-squared:
a. final on priGPA, ACT, GPAsq
b. final on priGPA, ACT, ACTsq
Briefly explain your answer.
a. Since GPAsq is more significant (higher t-stat in magnitude) than ACTsq in the
regression, we know that the R-squared will go down more if GPAsq is dropped. (We know
this because the F-stat, which is equal to the t-stat squared, is bigger.)

What is the estimated effect of ACT on expected final exam performance when
ACT = 20 and priGPA = 3.0?
The estimated effect of a one-point increase in ACT on expected final exam performance is
-0.5707+2*0.0196*20, or about 0.2133. (Note that GPA does not matter here.)
ACT coeff + 2*Actsq *20
