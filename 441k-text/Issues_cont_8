To estimate the model we would run OLS on the following equation:
log(wage) = β0 + δ0 female + β1 educ + δ1 female.educ + u
where female . educ is the interaction term obtained by simply
multiplying female and educ together

wage example,
wage = β0 + β1educ + β2exper + u
and the two groups are Males and Females. In this model we are
assuming that there is no difference between the model for females
and males
We can test whether this is valid by estimating,
wage = β0 + β1educ + β2exper+δ0female + δ1female*educ + δ2female*exper + u
and testing the hypothesis that
H0 : δ0 = 0, δ1 = 0, δ2 = 0
against the alternative that one of the coefficients is zero
Just do an F test ñ sometimes called a Chow test

Then for t-tests you just proceed as usual but instead use the robust
standard errors
For tests involving more than one coe¢ cient one needs the full robust
variance covariance matrix which in matrix notation looks like,
(X'X)^-1 X'SX(X'X)^-1 where S is a matrix that is zero everywhere except that the diagonals
are ˆui2
t=estimate-hypothesized value ) / robust se
