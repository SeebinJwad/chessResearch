Simultan causation model (SEM):
demand: qd = y1 * p+B1 * zd + ud
supply: qd = y2 * p+B2 * zs + us
equilibrium cond: qd = qs = q
zd zs demand and supply shifters, exogenous vars
reach equil as p adjusts in response to zd and zs and unobs shifters/shocks
"structural eqs" - structural paramaters include supp and dem elasticities related to yj
if q and p are in terms of log of quantity and price then yj are elasticities
ceteris paribus interp for yj

ols biased and incons for both eqs, need a z var corr w p not u
for demand eq that is zs for obs supply shifter vice versa

EIV: Error in vars
classical EIV lead to attenuation bias
y = b0+b1x* + u
x = x*+e
EIV IV SOLN:
Propose x2 as an instrument for x1:
y=B0+B1x1+u-B1e1
we need: x1 x2 corr w eachother, x2 uncorr w u-B1e1 and e1 e2 uncorr
Then, cov(x1,x2) = var(x*) > 0 and cov(x2,e1) = 0
