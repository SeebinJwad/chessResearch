1)Using the information provided find an expression for the F test statistic for
testing the overall goodness of fit of the regression and write down an appropriate
decision rule for the test such that the size (significance level) of the test is guaranteed to
be no larger than 5%.
F=((SST-SSR)/2)/(SSR/47)=((652.345-446.825)/2)/(446.825/47)
Reject null that both slopes are zero if F>F(2,47)= 3.15 (or a number between 3.15 and
3.23)

2)Suppose I wanted to test the hypothesis that fheight and mheight have the same
population slope coefficients. Write down formally the null hypothesis and indicate how
you would conduct a t-test of this hypothesis. (Note: You have all the information needed
to do this so write down the appropriate calculations that you would do to find the t
statistic and write down an appropriate decision rule with a significance level no larger
than 5%).
H0: fheight=mheight (meaning the coefficients of these variables â€“ could be
b_mheight=b_fheight
Reject H0 if t>t(47)_0.05 =2.00 (or number between 2.00 and 2.021)
T=(b_fheight-b_mheight)/(se(b_fheight-b_mheight))
B_fheight-b_mheight = 0.4819863-0.3723857
s.e. = sqrt(variance(b_fheight-b_mheight))
variance(b_fheight-b_mheight)=0.02042403+0.03869-2(-0.00937191)


3) How would you do an F test of the hypothesis in 2. In doing this write down
how you would get the SSR (or R squared) for the restricted model and how you would
find the F statistic and write down an appropriate decision rule with significance level no
larger than 5%.
Restricted model would be height = b0 + b1(fheight+mheight) + u
Impose that that b1=b2 on the unrestricted model.
F is the usual F formula in terms of SSR or R squared and reject if F>F(1,47)_0.05 so if
use the F(1,60)_0.05 = 4.00 you would guarantee the size is no larger than 0.05.
