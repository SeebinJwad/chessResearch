B0=y-B1^x, B1=Cov(xi,yi)/Var(xi), r=Cov(xi,yi)/sd(xi)*sd(yi)
sum of OLS residuals=0 Ei ui=0, sample covariance bw x and u =0 Eixiui^=0
point x,y means always on the OLS regression line
SST=SSE+SSR
R^2 = SSE/SST 
R^2= 1-(SSR/SST)
X * c OLS slope estimate 1/c
Y * c OLS slope and intercept * c
R2 does not change when we change the units of measurement
Variance of random var X is given by E((X-u)^2) where u=E(X)
o^2 = 1/(n-2) Ei ui^2 = SSR/(n-2)
E (u | x1, x2 ) = 0
variables can be correlated but not functionally related
age = β0 + β1exper + β2exper2 + u
Partial effect of exper: β1 + 2β2exper
y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 +.... + βk xk + u 
k independent variables plus intercept
k + 1 (unknown) population parameters
almost always will be u.
β1 = ˆβ1 +  ̃δ12 ˆβ2
  ̃δ12 is the regression coefficient from regression of x2 on x1
