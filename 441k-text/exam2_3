Test the null hypothesis that the return to experience is 10% against the one sided
alternative that the return to education is less than 10%.
t=(0.0663221-0.1)/0.0053094=-6.34<-t(1253) 0.05=-1.645
So we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative

Find a 90% confidence interval for the coefficient on female.
b – s.e.(b).t(1253) 0.05 < b0 < b – s.e.(b).t(1253) 0.05 - 2 points for this
-0.4532832 – 0.029217(1.645) < b0 <-0.4532832 + 0.029217(1.645) (full credit if all pieces there
-0.5013765 < b0 < -0.40519 (full credit also

What is the estimated partial effect of experience at 10 years of experience?
Bexper+2Bexpersq (exper) - 2 points for formula
0.0408305 +2(-0.0006301)(10) (full credit)
0.0282293

What additional piece of information would you need to be able to determine the
standard error of the estimated partial effect in 3?
Need the estimated covariance between the exper and expersq coefficients

At what level of experience will the return to experience be equal to zero? Is this
level practically relevant?
Exper * = -b exper/(2*b expersq ) - 2 points for formula
Exper * = -0.0408305/(2*(-0.0006301)) – 3 points
Exper * = -32.404
It is practically relevant since the largest value for experience is 48 years. 4 points if number if
correct and they made this conclusion.

Find the exact percentage difference in wages for females compared to males (with
males as the base group). Compare this to the approximation based on the coefficient multiplied
by 100.
100(exp(-0.4532832)-1) = -36.44% (2 points)
Approximation is 100*(0.4532832) = -45% (1 point)
Approximation is off by 9% (1 point

What is the interpretation of the coefficients on belavg and abvavg (recall how these
variables are defined)? (One sentence for each coefficient.)
Holding fixed gender, experience and education people with below average looks earn 15% less
than people with average looks (take off 1 point if did not say ``holding fixed...’’)
Holding fixed gender, experience and education people with above average looks earn 0.6% less
than people with average looks (take off 1 point if did not say ``holding fixed...’’)

Are the beauty variables individually significant using a 5% level test?
Belavg is significant at 5% level since p value 0.000
Abvavg is not significant at 5% level since p value is 0.82

How confident are you that the true coefficient on belavg is at least -0.2372479?
90% - (-.2372479, infinity) is the 90% one sided confidence interval

Suppose I had created the dummy variable avg=1-belavg-abvavg and used avg
instead of belavg. Find the new coefficients in this form of the regression.
New intercept = 0.558981 -0.1542 ( 1 point) (sub cons_ - belavg coeff)
Coeff on avg = 0.1542 (1 point) (belavg)
Coeff on abvavg = -0.0066465 – (-0.1542032) (1 point) (abvavg - belavg)
Other coefficients will be the same (2points)
