This section uses data on Texas non-agricultural employment (txnag) and (rest of US) non-
agricultural employment (usnag) which is quarterly over the period 1974Q1 to 1988Q1 – ie 57
quarterly observations. Here are time series plots of these variables followed by a couple of
AR(1) regressions:
For each variables (ie txnag and usnag) discuss whether you think the variable
is stationary or not. Indicate what aspect of the output lead you to that conclusion.
Both trend upwards based on the graphs (2 points)
If say that the AR(1) coefficients are close to 1 so RW so therefore not stationary then that’s
worth 2 points or if they try and do t tests of b1=1 correctly then give 2 points --- they did not
have tables so could not do formal test

In view of your answer indicate whether or not you trust these results as
confirming a close ``causal’’ relationship between employment in Texas and elsewhere:

Do not Trust

It was decided that the variables should be differenced so that now ctxnag and cusnag contain
the changes in the variables (ie the change in employment relative to the previous quarter. An
AR(1) model for cusnag was estimated as follows:

cusnag coeff std err.
cusnag_1 | .7703361 .0887719 
_cons | 120.5466 66.00597 

Using this model forecast the value for usnag (ie not cusnag) for 1988Q2 and
1988Q3 using the fact that in 1988Q1 usnag=6545.12 and cusnag=987
Cusnag1988Q2 = 120.54 + 0.7703*987 =880.87 so usnag1988Q2=6545.12+880.87 =7426 (_cons+cusnag_1*987) + 6545.12
Cusnag1988Q3=120.54+0.7703*880.87 =799.11 so usnag1988Q3=7426+799.11 =8245.11 (_cons+cusnag_1*880.7) + 7426


Here is a regression of changes in txnag on usnag
What do you conclude about the relationship between changes in employment
based on this regression?
There is a significant positive association between changes employment in Texas and
changes elsewhere in the US – take off 1 if did not say changes and another 1 if did not say
stat. sig.

Assuming the residuals are homoskedastic which one of the following issues
might lead you to suspect that the standard errors are invalid:
