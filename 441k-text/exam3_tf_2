T If I pool independent cross-sections across time then it is reasonable to
assume the residuals are uncorrelated across time.
2. F For a random walk with a positive drift the best forecast of future values is
always equal to the most recent value.
3. T A variable that follows an MA(1) process is stationary and weakly
dependent.
4. F If a regressor is correlated with the residual in a regression model due to
omitted variables then one should use a proxy for the omitted variable as
an instrument to obtain consistent estimates.
5. T With panel data one can remove the individual specific component of the
residual by taking first differences across time of the dependent variable
and regressors.
6. F In the linear probability model the fitted values lie in between 0 and 1.
7. T In the probit model the sign of the estimated coefficient on a regressor
indicates the direction of the effect of that variable on the probability that
the dependent variable is 1.
8. F In the linear probability model the inherent heteroskedasticity in the
residual implies that OLS estimates will be biased.
9. T If y and x have linear time trends then the regression of y on x should also
include time as a regressor to avoid the spurious regression problem.
10. T In a panel data model if the individual specific component of the residual
is correlated with the regressor then pooled OLS will be unbiased
