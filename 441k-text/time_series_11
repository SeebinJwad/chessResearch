stochastic or time ser process, temporal ordering, past affect fut
static model relating y to z:
yt=B0+B1zt+ut
finite dist lag models:
gfr(t = a0 + sigma0 pe(t + sigma1*pe(t-1 +..(t-2+ut
gfr (t is gen fertility rate and pe(t personal tax exempt at time t
this model recognises that the decision to have children may not
immediately change when pet changes(may be lagged response)
to interpret cetpar effect z on y, define 2 multipliers:
impact propensity/multiplier is sigma 0 (immediate impact of one unit inc in z at time t on y)
long run prop/mult sigma0+1+2.. (long run change in y due to permanent one unit inc in z)
we can do f-test to see if z has lagged effect ony, fdl contains the static model as special case
often corr in z at diff lags, multicollin(large se) can be diff to get precise estimate of sigma j. but good estimate lrp, we can add more vars to fdl
ZCM: for each t, error ut ut|X = 0, uncorr w each explanatory var in every time period, feedback y into future x then violated, if not then contemp exogenous (ut x uncorr), if corr(ut,xsj) uncorr when s not t, strictly exog, need stronger assumption for ols unbias
EXAMPLE TIME SERIES: Static Phillips Curve.
int = β0 + β1unempt + ut (3)
where int is the ináation rate
unempt is the unemployment rate
People used to think there was a tradeoff between inflation and
unemployment
Then the 70's happened and thought changed - macroeconomics changed
EXAMPLE TIME SERIES:
Explaining the Murder Rate.
mrdrtet = β0 + β1convrtet + β2unempt + β3yngmlet + ut (3)
where mrdrtet is the no. of murders per 10,000 people during year t,
convrtet is the murder conviction rate,
unempt is the unemployment rate and
yngmlet is the fraction of the population who are males aged 18-25 years
= can include many independent variables
