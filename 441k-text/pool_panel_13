pooled cross sect- indep cross sect at diff times
panel data- same cross sect across time
DIFF IN DIFF
diff-in-diff, better estimate of policy is change in price diff is effect of policy
rprice=B0+B1nearinc+B2 1981 + sigma nearinc * 1981+u
sigma will capture difference in effect of nearinc in 1981 compared to 1978
natural experiment - policy affecting one group (treatment) but not control
PANEL DATA
It is possible to use panel just like pooled cross-sections, but in general we shouldnt need to: take into account corr in unobservables across time for each unit
panel data can be used to address some omit var bias, if omit vars are constant, they form part of composite error term
yt = B0+sigma 0 d2t + B1 xt + ai + ut t=1,2, uit time varying error
ai captures all unobserved time constant factors
ai called a fixed effect or indiv heterogen or unobs heterogen
pooled ols fine if zcm or mlr4 is satisfied
if ai eliminated-ols strict exogeneity
with T>2, take avg across time, y= 1/T(B0...
