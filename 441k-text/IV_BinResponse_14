lin prob model - use multiple regression explain qual outcome
y not normal, bernoulli(p) y ~ bern(p) mean:
p(y=1)=p, p(y=0)=1-p, ie flip-y=1 if heads p=1/2
y~Bernoulli(p), E(y)=p, V(y)=p(1-p)
linprob model - E(Y | x1..xk) = P(y=1 | x1,..,xk)=
=y = B0+B1x1..Bkxk+u where E(u|x1..xk)=0, OLS not best estimate,WLS
Bj measures change in prob of success when xj change one unit, cetpar
lnLF=.586+.038educ-.016age+other factors
lnLF=1 is woman in labor, if educ inc by 10, prob of labor inc by .038*10=.38, large
probit model, sign Bj determine direction of change, value is theta(B0..Bkxk),non-dummy vars only
OMMITED VARS:
instrumental var soln to ommited vars:
log(wage)=B0+B1educ+u
what if no proxy? find z (IV) that satisfies:
cov(z,u)=0, cov(z,educ)=/=0, get consistent estimate B1
crucial cov(z,educ) not 0, thus educ=pi 0 + pi 1 *z+v, test pi 1 = 0 
proxy not an instrument!
Estimating 'causal' effect skip class on score
score=B0+B1skipped=u, if more interested students skip less classes and do bettter, skipped corr with u
1) must be corr w num skipped classes ie explain skipped
2) be uncorr with other unobs factors affecting score
when one has more thna one instrument for y2, one can tests maintained assumption zk+1..,zk+I are actually uncorr w u, overidentifying restriction
hausman test whether y2 is actually corr w u
