Using this regression and the previous one test the hypothesis (using a 5%
significance level) that age does not matter for sleep. Be sure to write down the
appropriate hypotheses (null and alternative) and construct the appropriate test statistic
for testing the null hypothesis.
H0: b_age =b_agesq =0
H1: H0 false
2 points for hypotheses
F=(SSRR - SSRU)/2/( SSRU /(n-k-1)) = (122631662-122147777)/2/(122147777/(706-5-1))
= 1.39 < F(2,700) = 3.00
1 point for F stat formula and 1 point for correct test stat and conclusion.
Therefore do not reject the null. If they used t tests then take of 2 points.

What is the effect of having young kids if the person is female?
-88.76846 (coeff yngkid)
What is the effect of having young kids if the person is a male?
-88.76846 + 128.0439 = 39.28 (add maleyng and yngkid coeffs)

n this model how does one interpret the coefficients on age and agesq?
The effect of age is given by -8.69 +2(0.128)(age) – the effect of age is initially negative but
becomes less negative as age increases – this is a U shaped relationship.

Using one sentence for each, interpret the estimated coefficients on the
variables totwrk, educ and male.
An increase in totwrk of 1 minute is predicted to decrease sleep by 0.163 minutes holding
fixed educ, age and sex.
An increase in education of 1 year is predicted to decrease sleep by 11.7 minutes holding
fixed .....
Men sleep 87.7 minutes more than women holding fixed work, educ and and age
2 for each – take points off for neglecting the ``holding fixed’’ part.

omeone points out that there may be unobserved factors that affect both sleep
and work. Would this lead you to suspect that one of the assumptions (MLRM.1-6) is
violated? If so, which one and why is it possibly violated.
Assumption 4. If the unobserved factor affects sleep then it is in u – if this also affects work
then u will be correlated with totwrk violating the ZCM assumption. Use your judgment for
partial credit.
